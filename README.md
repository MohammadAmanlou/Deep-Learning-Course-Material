## 📊 Grading Policy
The final grade (out of 20) is distributed as follows:
- **Midterm and Final Exam:** 4 points
- **Assignments:** 6 assignments, each worth **2 points** (total **12 points**)
- **Final Project:** 4 points

## 📝 Exams
- A **final exam** will be scheduled at a predetermined time.
- **Attendance for the final exam is mandatory** as per university regulations.

## 📂 Assignments
- **Total:** 6 assignments + 1 final project
- **Group Work:** Assignments can be done individually or in **pairs (max 2 students per group)**.
- **Accountability:** Each group member must be able to explain their solutions.
- **Group Changes:** You can change groups for each assignment, but all group members must be declared when submitting an assignment.

## ⏳ Late Policy
- **Penalty:** A 10% deduction per day for late submissions.
- **Grace Period:** A total of **6 days** for the entire course.
- **Final Project:** No late submissions allowed.

## 🚨 Cheating Policy
Your work is considered **cheating** if:
- You use publicly available code as a solution.
- You copy someone else's work.
- You mistakenly submit someone else's work.
- You submit answers generated by AI (e.g., ChatGPT) **without understanding them**.

**Penalties:**
- **Cheating on an assignment** results in a **zero score** for all involved students.
- **Cheating may be detected at any time** during the term.
- **Cheating on an exam** follows university regulations and may lead to disciplinary action.
